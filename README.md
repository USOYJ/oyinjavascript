challenge 3 password generator
<p>The password generator challenge was a very interesting javascript exercise, the dev tool console kept saying I had an error in my code and for 2 hours I was looking at my code, only to find out I didn't close the bracket on my "isNAN" function. Urgghh so don't be like me and make sure you pay attention to your code as you write it</p>

<h1>About the Challenge:</h1>
<p>This helped me understand Javascript a little more because I had to look on various websites and on youtube to get this done.
In class I mostly got to see the "var" varible shine but I found out they were more and the 3 most popular are the "Var, let and Const" variable. Also found out about the isNaN funtion which stands for is not a number and what this function does is, it helps to return  "True" if the value is not a number.</p>
<p>The password generator basically has prompts before it generates a password, these prompts are conditions it has to satisfy before generating the password.</p>
